#todo genereate x inputs of the original total input, where each new x total is a tenth of the previus one. Store the results of each xtotal, and make a graph of the data.  Figure out how to store the data. and access it, and how to process that into a graph, where the xaxis is total, and the yaxis is the 'afvigelse i procent' -- when that is done, improve the program, so it can run more efficent, and be more user-friendly
